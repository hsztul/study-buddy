## Completed Sections

### 1.1 Real Grading with gpt-4o-mini âœ…

**Replaced mock grading with AI-powered evaluation**

- Created `lib/grader.ts` with Vercel AI SDK integration
- System prompt optimized for SAT vocabulary grading
- Three-tier grading: pass, almost, fail
- Zod schema validation for response structure
- Fallback to keyword matching if AI fails
- Verbose debug mode support

**Files Created:**
- âœ… `lib/grader.ts` - AI grading utility
- âœ… `lib/prompts.ts` - System prompts for grading
- âœ… Updated `app/api/test/attempt/route.ts` - Now uses AI grading

**Grading Criteria:**
- **Pass**: Captures core meaning + 1-2 key facets
- **Almost**: Partially correct, missing critical element
- **Fail**: Incorrect or off-topic

---

### 1.2 Spaced Repetition (SR) Scheduling âœ…

**Implemented simple but effective SR algorithm**

- Created `lib/spaced-repetition.ts` with SR logic
- Algorithm rules:
  - **Pass**: streak += 1, double interval (cap 21 days)
  - **Almost**: halve interval, keep streak
  - **Fail**: reset to 1 day, streak = 0
- Integrated with attempt API
- Updated test queue to prioritize SR-due words
- SR stats calculation (due today, average interval)

**Files Created:**
- âœ… `lib/spaced-repetition.ts` - SR algorithm and utilities
- âœ… Updated `app/api/test/attempt/route.ts` - Calls SR after grading
- âœ… Updated `app/api/test/next/route.ts` - Prioritizes due words

**Features:**
- Automatic due date calculation
- Streak tracking
- Due word prioritization in test queue
- SR statistics for profile

### 1.3 Stats & Profile Page âœ…

**Comprehensive analytics and progress tracking**

- Created stats overview API
- Profile page with multiple components
- Real-time accuracy tracking
- Per-word progress table
- Daily accuracy chart
- Due words list

**Files Created:**
- âœ… `app/api/stats/overview/route.ts` - Stats aggregation API
- âœ… `components/profile/stats-tiles.tsx` - Overview tiles
- âœ… `components/profile/accuracy-chart.tsx` - 7-day trend chart
- âœ… `components/profile/word-stats-table.tsx` - Per-word progress
- âœ… `components/profile/due-list.tsx` - Words due for review
- âœ… Updated `app/(app)/profile/page.tsx` - Complete profile UI

**Stats Included:**
- Total words studied
- Words due today
- 7-day accuracy percentage
- Average interval days
- Per-word: streak, accuracy, attempts, due date
- Daily accuracy trend (last 7 days)

---

### 1.4 Daily Stats Aggregation âœ…

**Background stats processing**

- Created aggregation utility
- Upserts to `user_daily_stats` table
- Admin API for recomputing due dates

**Files Created:**
- âœ… `lib/aggregate-stats.ts` - Daily stats aggregation
- âœ… `app/api/admin/recompute-due/route.ts` - Admin utility

---

### 1.5 PWA Configuration âœ…

**Progressive Web App setup**

- Created web manifest
- Added PWA meta tags
- iOS-specific configuration
- App shortcuts for Review and Test modes

**Files Created:**
- âœ… `public/manifest.webmanifest` - PWA manifest
- âœ… Updated `app/layout.tsx` - PWA meta tags

**PWA Features:**
- Installable on mobile and desktop
- Standalone display mode
- Custom theme color (#2563eb)
- App shortcuts
- Portrait orientation lock

**Note:** App icons (192x192, 512x512) need to be created and placed in `/public/`
