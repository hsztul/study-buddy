# Dictionary Scraper Implementation

## Overview

Built a custom dictionary scraping system to provide fallback when the freeDictionaryAPI is unavailable or experiencing issues.

## Architecture

### Multi-Source Strategy
1. **Primary**: Google Dictionary Scraper
   - Fast and comprehensive
   - Scrapes dictionary widget from Google search results
   - Generally reliable for common words
   
2. **Fallback**: Wiktionary Scraper
   - Open-source, reliable
   - Scrapes from `en.wiktionary.org`
   - No rate limiting concerns
   - Used when Google fails or is blocked

**Note**: The freeDictionaryAPI was removed due to frequent timeouts and reliability issues.

## Implementation

### Files Created

```
lib/scrapers/
├── scraper-types.ts          # TypeScript interfaces
├── wiktionary-scraper.ts     # Primary scraper
├── google-scraper.ts         # Fallback scraper
├── scraper-manager.ts        # Orchestration logic
├── test-scrapers.ts          # Test script
└── debug-wiktionary.ts       # Debug utility
```

### Key Features

**Scraper Manager**
- Automatic fallback logic
- 7-day cache for scraped data (stable content)
- Sequential scraper attempts with delays
- Unified interface

**Wiktionary Scraper**
- Parses HTML using Cheerio
- Extracts definitions, part of speech, examples
- Handles Wiktionary's `.mw-heading` structure
- Filters valid POS types (Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.)

**Google Scraper**
- Searches "define [word]"
- Parses dictionary widget from results
- Multiple parsing strategies for different layouts
- User-agent rotation to avoid blocks

**Integration**
- Updated `lib/dictionary.ts` to use scrapers directly
- Removed unreliable freeDictionaryAPI calls
- Google scraper is tried first, Wiktionary as fallback
- Converts scraped data to standard format
- Maintains existing interface (no breaking changes)
- Fixed Next.js 15 async params in API routes

## Testing

Run test script:
```bash
npx tsx lib/scrapers/test-scrapers.ts
```

Test results showed:
- ✓ API working: Direct responses
- ✓ API timeout: Wiktionary fallback successful
- ✓ Definitions extracted with examples
- ✓ Multiple parts of speech handled correctly

## Usage

No changes needed to existing code. The fallback is automatic:

```typescript
import { getWordDefinitions } from '@/lib/dictionary';

// Automatically tries API first, falls back to scrapers
const definitions = await getWordDefinitions('algorithm');
```

## Performance

- **Google scraper**: ~3-5s (includes fetch + parse)
- **Wiktionary scraper**: ~2-3s (includes fetch + parse)
- **Caching**: 24h cache duration, reduces repeated lookups
- **Scraper manager**: 7-day internal cache for stability

## Advantages

1. **Reliability**: Multiple sources ensure uptime
2. **No API keys**: All sources are free
3. **Scalable**: Can add more scrapers easily
4. **Smart caching**: Reduces scraping overhead
5. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns

## Limitations

1. **Scraping speed**: Slower than direct API
2. **HTML fragility**: Scrapers may break if sites change structure
3. **Rate limiting**: Google may block heavy usage
4. **Text cleaning**: Some scraped text needs better formatting

## Future Improvements

1. Add more scraper sources (Dictionary.com, Merriam-Webster)
2. Improve text extraction and cleaning
3. Add Redis for production caching
4. Implement proxy rotation for Google scraper
5. Add monitoring/alerts for scraper failures
6. Better synonym/antonym extraction
